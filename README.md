- Create an account on Poeditor
- Go to https://poeditor.com/join/project?hash=OPKZDZUHAG
- Select the language of your choice, and then start translating!

> If you don't see your language in the project menu, please contact us on [our support server](https://discord.gg/m9KPuW4TbA) so we could add support for a language of your choice!

### 💻 Pull requesting by yourself
#### File structure (if you're going to change the file manually)
Create a file named `[YourLanguageCode].json`, and copy the contents of<br>`en-US.json` in it and start translating.
